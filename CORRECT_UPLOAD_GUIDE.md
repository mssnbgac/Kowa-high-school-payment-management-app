# ✅ CORRECT: Don't Upload node_modules

## What's Happening (This is NORMAL):
- `node_modules` folder is NOT uploading to GitHub
- This is **CORRECT** and **EXPECTED**
- The `.gitignore` file prevents this (saves space and time)

## What TO Upload (Only These Files):

### ✅ DO Upload:
```
📁 src/ folder (all contents)
📁 public/ folder (all contents)
📄 package.json
📄 vercel.json
📄 .gitignore
📄 README.md
```

### ❌ DON'T Upload:
```
📁 node_modules/ (too big, auto-generated)
📁 build/ (auto-generated by Vercel)
📁 .vscode/ (IDE settings)
```

## How Vercel Works:
1. **You upload:** Source code + package.json
2. **Vercel automatically:** 
   - Runs `npm install` (creates node_modules)
   - Runs `npm run build` (creates build folder)
   - Deploys your site

## Upload Process:
1. **GitHub:** Upload only source files (no node_modules)
2. **Vercel:** Reads package.json and installs dependencies automatically
3. **Result:** Working website!

## If Build Still Fails:
Try this in Vercel project settings:
- **Framework:** Create React App
- **Build Command:** `npm ci && npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `build`
- **Node.js Version:** 18.x

**You're doing it RIGHT by not uploading node_modules!** 🎉
